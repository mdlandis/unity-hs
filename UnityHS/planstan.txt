- My project was pretty ambitious.
- "Make Hearthstone."
- Do as much as I can until I simply ran out of time.
- I accomplished: 
	Reads in a card list from a text file
	Minions, spells, weapons
	Battlecry, deathrattle, "triggered"

- No multiplayer, here's some very brief sample gameplay (30 seconds).
- As far as code goes, there are like 90 classes, 9 of them are actually major and significant, 20 of them are smaller, and the remaining like 60 are all the card effects.
- Some of the more interesting parts of the code:
	Giving cards their effects and images and stuff uses filename
	Minion SetCard FINDS THE CLASS GIVEN BY THE FILENAME AND PUTS IT ON THE OBJECT WOW SO COOL
	Conditional Battlecries and stuff
	THEORETICALLY EXTENSIBLE?!?!?
